My name is Zhenyu Liu(刘震宇, Líu Zhènyû)I am an undergraduate student in Software Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).

**Research:** Now I am working on neural network compression, as well as their deployment on hardware, and their acceleration on hardware like FPGA, Nvidia Jetson Xavier. I have made several explorations to the model quantization and distillation. And I would like to do more research in related fields or high performance computing in the future.

**Quantization and Efficient Deployment of Neural Networks**

This project is to deploy a NN for analyzing radar echoes on a hardware platform with limited computing resources. We complete the quantization of the NN and the hardware implementation. After verifying the project on Xilinx's Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102 board, we furtherly deploy it on ZED-7020. Finally,we can reduce both the energy consumption and thecircuit areas significantly without affecting the performance.
