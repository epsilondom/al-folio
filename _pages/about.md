Hi! I am an undergraduate student in Software Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).

My current research interests include neural network compression, efficient deep learning, FPGA, and transfer learning.

## Selected Projects


![project1](project1.png)

**Quantization and Efficient Deployment of Neural Networks**

This project is to deploy a NN for analyzing radar echoes on a hardware platform with limited computing resources. We complete the quantization of the NN and the hardware implementation. After verifying the project on Xilinx's Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102 board, we furtherly deploy it on ZED-7020. Finally,we can reduce both the energy consumption and thecircuit areas significantly without affecting the performance.
